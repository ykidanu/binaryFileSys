project2 basically asks for user input and based on input builds a file sys then writes it to a binfile.
It also reads it back into a directory object and prints out the starting location for significant information.
type make into the prompt to compile and run the program.
My code uses C++11 syntax in some locations which is i modified the make file to use it on rucs.
On my linux box it doesn't require the modifed makefile.
the goal of this project was to make a binary filesys simulation.
